# Elite-Gallery

## Description

A very basic gallery that I coded for my own use, to display screenshots from the Elite: Dangerous space sim in a pleasant way. It's based on my obsessive side when it comes to filenames and depends on a few conventions:
* image files are in the same directory as the code
* image names are in the `YYYYMMDDHHMM_image_name.jpg` format
* a text file containing descriptions for these images is in the same directory
* the descriptions file contains one description per line
* each description line is in the `filename : description` format
